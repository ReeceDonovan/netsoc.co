Our new fancy website.

## Local development
- Prerequisits: Node.js and NPM
- After cloning the repo, run `npm i` in the base directory.
- To start the website, run `npm start`.
- If you wish to hook it up to the events api, you can do either:
  1. Set the API_URL environment variable to `https://events.netsoc.dev` before you run `npm start`
  2. Download the [dev-env](https://github.com/UCCNetsoc/dev-env) and run the discord bot with `./dev-env up discord-bot consul`

Thanks for contributing :)
